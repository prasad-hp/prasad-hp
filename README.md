ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Prasad (he/him)!

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building on technology and solving problems.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development, specifically the MERN Stack.

ðŸ“« You can reach me at: prasadhp@outlook.in

âš¡ About Me:
   I have a background in Mechanical Engineering and have previously worked in the field of designing. I tried out Retail Banking and realized that it wasn't my calling.  However, I later discovered that my passion lies in building things and solving problems, which led me to explore coding. So I decided to pursue my interest in coding. Currently, I'm on a journey of self-exploration while learning to code and build things.

ðŸš€ I'm excited to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts, collaborate on projects, and continue growing in the tech community!
